# Counting Nucleotide Occurrences in DNA Sequences Using Python

This document explains how to use python script provided in this repository to count the occurrences of individual nucleotides (A, C, G, T) in DNA sequences. The script can handle both plain text files and FASTA files.

## How to use the script

1. Download the Script file:
    - download the script file. Either rename it or use as it is.

2. Prepare Input Files:
    - Go through the script. Ensure that the file name provided within the script, for example, `example.txt` or `CDKN1B.fasta`, is in the same directory as the script or provide the full path to the file.

3. Run the Script:
    - Open terminal or command prompt.
    - Navigate to the directory where the script is saved.
    - Run the script using Python:

    ```bash
    python nucleotide_count.py # nucleotide_count.py is the name of my python script file.
    ```

4. Output:
    - The script will output the counts of 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T' in the DNA sequence from the specified file.
