# Nucleotide Counting Methods

This repository showcases various methods for counting individual nucleotide occurences in DNA sequences from different file formats, including text files and FASTA files. The project demonstrates how to use tools such as 'grep', 'awk', 'bioawk', 'Python', and 'R' for this purpose. Each method is provided with clear examples, explanations and scripts, making it easy to understand and replicate the counting process in projects.
